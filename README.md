# CHT-versus-Rombergs-dataset
This is the public dataset of my research paper comparing Curthoys Halmagyi-Curthoys test versus Rombergs test.

The entire research work was done using Python SciPy module.
Proprietary software was not used as it is against the principles of the authors, Dr Santhosh Kumar Rajamani and Radha Srinivasan Iyer.
